# OpenStack Telemetry

*DEV/TEST ONLY*: This unstable, development example bundle extends the basic OpenStack Cloud bundle with Telemetry collection via Ceilometer. See also: [Stable Bundles](https://jujucharms.com/u/openstack-charmers).

Certain configuration options within the bundle may need to be adjusted prior to deployment to fit your particular set of hardware. For example, network device names and block device names can vary, and passwords should be yours.

For full details on the base cloud deployment please refer to the [Basic OpenStack Cloud][] bundle.
